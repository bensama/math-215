"""**Import the data set**

The simplest way to load the data into Colab is to first download it as a .csv file to your local computer by clicking the link

https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1iFTaBmnv1X66BO9cV_RP7OxvUr9dNJ-l

This will bring up the option to download the data as a .csv file. Once it has finished downloading, execute the following cell.  This will bring up an option to choose files from your local computer to upload to Google Colab (note that the cell will not finish executing until you download the file).  Push the "Browse" or "Choose Files" button, and locate the file titled "Lab7data.csv" on your local computer.

"""**STOP!  BEFORE YOU SUBMIT THIS LAB:**  Go to the "Runtime" menu at the top of this page, and select "Restart and run all".  If any of the cells produce error messages, you will either need to fix the error(s) or delete the code that is causing the error(s).  Then use "Restart and run all" again to see if there are any new errors.  Repeat this until no new error messages show up.

**You are not ready to submit until you are able to select "Restart and run all" without any new error messages showing up.  Your code will not be able to be graded if there are any error messages.**

To submit your lab for grading you must first download it to your compute as .py file. In the "File" menu select "Download .py". The resulting file can then be uploaded to http://www.math.byu.edu:30000 for grading.
